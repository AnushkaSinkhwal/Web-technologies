        <h2> Personal Life</h2>
            <p> Hi I am Anushka SInkhwal.I was born on 7th July 2004 in Bhaktapur. I have a small family with 3 members. I live with my mom and brother . Growing up in a middle class family, my parents have very high expectations on me. My mother works very hard to fulfill our needs whereas my brother studies abroad. I lost my father at a very young age due to illness.So I have realised that I have a very huge responsibilty in my family.</p>

                I have always wanted to be an IT professional. I want to
learn programming and coding and as I have dreamt of developing new applications and
softwares , I would love to work on it . I am also fascinated how AI and development of robots
are causing huge changes in todayâ€™s world. I have participated in events related to robots in my
school. I believe that was the push I needed to continue my studies in computer science.
                 Since I was young I have always been interested in various events
                    taking place in the school besides studying . I have participated in many competitions like debate
                    competitions, poem writing , dancing , dramas and many more . I always wanted to learn new things and explore.</p>
